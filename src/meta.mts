[h3]All changes to the base game:[/h3]
[list]
 [*] [Challenge] No enemy markers. No threat indicators.
 [*] [Challenge] Armors don't take head slot (except for SEVA's), but also don't protect from PSY damage, so you need to use helmets.
 [*] [QoL] Prevents Player and NPCs from being knocked down.
 [*] [QoL] Removes Fall damage for Player and NPCs.
 [*] [QoL] Removes instakill effect from invisible border guards as well as spawned guards.
 [*] [Challenge / QoL] Way more lively zone, now spawning all mutant bosses and bigger battles.
 [*] [QoL/Balance] There is now no cooldown between repeatable quests.
 [*] [Challenge] Increases cost of everything to 400% (üí£ ammo, üõ†Ô∏è repair, ‚öôÔ∏è upgrade, üç∫ consumables, üõ°Ô∏è armor, üî´ weapon, üîÆ artifact).
 [*] [Balance] Increases cost of Attachments to 1000%.
 [*] [Balance] Repeatable Quest Rewards are increased to 400%, but are made random with 25% spread both ways.

 [*] [Balance] Removes armor from vanilla mutants.
 [*] [Balance] NPCs drop armor, but it is damaged and will cost a lot to repair.
 [*] [Challenge] Reduced üíä Consumables, üî´ Ammo, and üí£ Grenades drops from bodies and stashes.
